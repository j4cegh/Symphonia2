# Symphonia2
this is my audio player, I use it to listen to music while playing games or I have nothing to do.

# Features
* no pausing (it's not a bug, it's a feature ðŸ˜‚) 
fr I tried but no logic
* playing from folder
* no playlists (yet. Might implement in a scuffed way by looping through all the songs in a folder)
* stop button
* looping
* Discord RPC
* support for .wav and .mp3 (COULD be more, I do not know WMPLib's limitations, but my app supports those 2.)

# but you used to hide every code you make why you open source now
because free code = good code (not that I expect anyone to use it)
